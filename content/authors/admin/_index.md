I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Wei Chen. Prior to that, I received my B.S. with honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I studied Materials Science & Engineering and Computer Science.
